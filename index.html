			 <p>I&rsquo;ve written up a breakdown of my itinerary for the Tour du Mont Blanc <a href="https://pinthewild.micro.blog/2025/08/08/tour-du-mont-blanc-itinerary.html">in a separate post</a> but I wanted to write this to talk about the costs of the trip.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be using euros (€) to keep the currencies consistent.</p>
<p>At the time of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>€1 = GBP 0.87</li>
<li>€1 = CHF 0.94</li>
</ul>
<p>which is close enough that I just read all prices as if they were in my own currency (£) 🤷.</p>
<h2 id="camping">Camping</h2>
<p>My hiking friend and I decided to take our tents and camp each night. This was not only because staying in hotels and refuges would have been much more expensive but because that&rsquo;s what we wanted the tour to be, a self-sufficient multi-day backpacking trip.</p>
<p>Apart from the very last one all of the campsites I stayed in accepted payment by card.</p>
<p>0: <a href="https://camping-bellevue-leshouches.com/">Bellevue campsite</a> 🇫🇷 €12 (before the tour)</p>
<p>1: <a href="https://www.campinglepontet.fr/">Camping le Pontet</a> 🇫🇷  €12 (<strong>minimum payment</strong> of €20 to pay by card)</p>
<p>2: Bivouac area in Les Chapieux 🇫🇷 €0</p>
<p>3: <a href="https://www.campinghobo.com/en/">Hobo Camping</a> 🇮🇹 €20</p>
<p>4: <a href="https://www.grandesjorasses.com/en/">Camping Grandes Jorasses</a> 🇮🇹 €14.50</p>
<p>5: <a href="https://www.camping-glaciers.ch/en/">Camping des Glaciers</a> 🇨🇭 €20</p>
<p>6: <a href="https://www.valleedutrient.ch/en/campsite-l-arpille-fp480">Campsite L&rsquo;Arpille</a> 🇨🇭 €15</p>
<p>7: <a href="https://www.campingchamonix.com/en/location/">Camping Glacier D&rsquo;Argentière</a> 🇫🇷 €12</p>
<p>8: Bivouac area next to <a href="https://www.maisondesdrus.com/en/establishment/refuge-flegere-summer/">Refuge de la Flégère</a>  🇫🇷 €0</p>
<p>9: <a href="https://www.lesarolles.com/en-gb">Les Arolles</a> 🇫🇷 €14.20 (after the tour, <strong>cash only</strong>)</p>
<p>Campsites on the tour: €93.50</p>
<p>Start and end: €26.20</p>
<p>Total: €119.70</p>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>We ate mainly &ldquo;hiking fuel&rdquo; that we bought from supermarkets. This included fruits, meats, cheeses, noodles, pastries and ready-made sandwiches as well as sweets and chocolates.</p>
<p>It is with great privilege that I can say that in France and Italy these were all &ldquo;regular&rdquo; prices. The shops in the campsites were also fairly priced, which was a pleasant surprise. I spent around €20 each day on food from supermarkets.</p>
<p>In Switzerland most things were a little more expensive and some things were a lot more. In France I enjoyed two steaks from the supermarket that were €5 each but in Switzerland they were about €20. I did buy a bag of Fondue cheese in Switzerland which was about €15 but this was a treat and I managed to get 3 &ldquo;meals&rdquo; out of it, so it ended up reasonably affordable.</p>
<p>For this trip I took a saucepan and a frying pan and this meant we were able to cook things like pasta and sausages which kept the costs down.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t see many places selling dehydrated meals but we weren&rsquo;t interested in those.</p>
<p>Attached is a photo of a restaurant in Champex-Lac in Switzerland which explains why we walked straight past it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The food in the refuges seems a little expensive but when you remember where you are, that supplies are delivered by helicopter, and that you&rsquo;re mainly paying for a warm, dry place to rest in they are completely justified in charging what they do.</p>
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<h3 id="flights">Flights</h3>
<p>I flew from Manchester to Geneva with my backpack as checked baggage. I used <a href="https://www.skyscanner.net/">Skyscanner</a> to find an <a href="https://www.easyjet.com/en/buy/cabin-bags">easyJet</a> flight that departed at 09:00 and arrived at 10:55, which was 11:55 in local time.</p>
<p>This cost me €260.</p>
<p>I could have instead flown to and from Lyon in France for about €100, which is much cheaper, but I would have had to sort out extra travel. I knew on the last day I would be tired and so I was prepared to pay extra to keep things simple.</p>
<h3 id="transfer">Transfer</h3>
<p>To get from Geneva airport to Chamonix and back I used <a href="https://www.omio.com/">Omio</a> to book a coach with SwissTours. This cost me €10 each way, and paying the driver would have been €30, so I&rsquo;m glad I pre-booked.</p>
<p>The bus from Chamonix to Les Houches is €2.20 which you can buy from the ticket seller at Chamonix Sud bus station, although you can probably pay with card once you&rsquo;re on the bus.</p>
<h3 id="cable-car">Cable car</h3>
<p>On the first day we used the cable car to save some time, which was around €20 for a one way ticket.</p>
<h3 id="buses">Buses</h3>
<p>In France the buses were €2.20, which you paid on the bus using the ticket machine, although one morning the machines didn&rsquo;t work and we rode the 2 stops into town for free.</p>
<p>In Italy the buses we took around Courmayeur to and from our campsites were completely free.</p>
<h2 id="cash">Cash</h2>
<p>The currency of France and Italy is the Euro. Living in Britain means I can go to any currency converter and get this the same day. Easy.</p>
<p>Switzerland however uses the Swiss Franc (CHF) and for me this would have involved ordering it a week in advance. I did not leave enough time for this, so I was planning on just using Euros.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a €50 note in my suitcase for the last five years that needed spending so I only wanted to convert another €50, but my local shop wanted me to buy a minimum of €200. I didn&rsquo;t want any more Euros lying around the place, so I only took the €50 and used my card for everything else.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not making this up; I used the last of that €50 note on the final camp site because it was cash only. I came home with none of it left, not even coins. Success!</p>
<p>The campsites, supermarkets and even some of the refuges we visited accepted card, so I didn&rsquo;t need much cash anyway. If we had gone to different campsites or stopped at more refuges for food and drinks then we might have needed more.</p>
<p>Apparently the Swiss places that don&rsquo;t take card will accept Euros instead of Francs but we didn&rsquo;t find any and only paid by card in Switzerland.</p>
<h2 id="total">Total</h2>
<p>I spent €421.95 on card and €50 in cash, totalling <strong>€471.95</strong> (<strong>£409.60</strong>).</p>
<p>Add on the €260 for flights and €20 for airport transfers and it&rsquo;s up to <strong>€751.95</strong> (<strong>£652.67</strong>).</p>
<p>The costs have been kept low by staying on campsites instead of in hotels, so there&rsquo;s an indirect cost for my tent and sleeping equipment, but let&rsquo;s ignore those.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not at work right now, but it would have involved me taking 7 days holiday. I spent the first 3 days back home mentally foggy, so if I worked for myself I would consider these unpaid days off.</p>
<h2 id="worth-it">Worth it?</h2>
<p>I had a beautiful trip to three amazing countries.</p>
<p>I broke my record for nights on the trail.</p>
<p>And most importantly, I conquered a massive personal challenge with an awesome new friend.</p>
<p>It was priceless; whichever currency you use to count it in.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I had the pleasure of hiking the Tour du Mont Blanc with <a href="https://pinthewild.micro.blog/2024/07/26/180000.html">Blue Backpack Cover</a>, whom I met last year on <a href="https://pinthewild.micro.blog/categories/west-highland-way/">The West Highland Way</a>.</p>
<p>I had no intention of going on a hiking trip this year, which seemed like a missed opportunity as I was taking a break from work for a while, but when I got an email inviting me to go I immediately said yes.</p>
<p>Even better, my hiking buddy already had a plan, so I didn&rsquo;t need to put much thought into it. I just turned up and walked.</p>
<h2 id="our-itinerary">Our Itinerary</h2>
<p>We had a rough plan of where we wanted to get to each day, but we were prepared to go with the flow and make adjustments when we needed to.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t book any part of our trip, which started for me on the 18th of July and ended on the 28th, apart from my flights and the coach from the airport.</p>
<p>We aimed to complete the tour in 9 days, which would give me plenty of time the day after to get to Geneva to catch my flight back home.</p>
<p>We camped in campsites and spent two nights bivouacking, which in France means you can setup late at night and leave early in the morning.</p>
<h3 id="0">0</h3>
<p>I decided to camp near the starting point so I could have a reasonable night&rsquo;s sleep before I started.</p>
<p>I flew from Manchester at 09:00 and arrived at Geneva airport at 12:00. As a UK citizen it took an hour to get through security, after which I took a pre-booked SwissTours coach at 13:30 to Chamonix. I bought the ticket the night before for €10 using <a href="https://www.omio.com/">Omio</a>, instead of buying it from the driver for €30.</p>
<p>After a brief tour of Chamonix I bought a €2.20 ticket from the seller outside the Chamonix Sud bus station and caught the number 1 bus to Les Houches, getting off at the Bellevue stop before walking 5 minutes to the <a href="https://camping-bellevue-leshouches.com/">Bellevue campsite</a> which was €12 for me and my tent.</p>
<h3 id="1">1</h3>
<p>After meeting my hiking buddy and getting supplies from the Carrefour supermarket in Les Houches we noticed we were starting late and so paid €20 to use the cable car to skip the first 800m of ascent.</p>
<p>We stayed at <a href="https://www.campinglepontet.fr/">Camping le Pontet</a> for the first night, which was €12 each.</p>
<p>Les Houches to Les Contamines: 15km with 300m elevation gain.</p>
<h3 id="2">2</h3>
<p>Our destination for the second night was the bivouac area in Les Chapieux, somewhere we couldn&rsquo;t have booked even if we wanted to.</p>
<p>When we arrived we set up our tents on the outside of the area and noticed everybody was leaving the middle bit empty. As soon as that afternoon&rsquo;s storm started up I understood why; so much rain came down that huge puddles were forming in the middle of the field. During a gap in the downpour I noticed that about 10 tents had packed up and disappeared, presumably soaked through in one way or another.</p>
<p>Next to the bivouac area are two bars that sell pizzas that you can take away, so that was dinner sorted.</p>
<p>The valley has no phone service, so send any messages and look up the latest forecast at the top of the hill before the descent.</p>
<p>Les Contamines to Les Chapieux: 20km with 1282m elevation gain.</p>
<h3 id="3">3</h3>
<p>We grabbed breakfast and lunch from the shop attached to one of the bars and set off towards Italy, crossing the non-existent border about lunch time.</p>
<p>We had to leave the official tour to reach our campsite but it was well sign posted and easy to find.</p>
<p>We stayed at <a href="https://www.campinghobo.com/en/">Hobo Camping</a> which was about €20 each and so more expensive than the French campsites so far but the facilities were nicer so it was acceptable. The €8 increase easily covered the upgrade from a hole in the floor to a seated toilet with a bidet.</p>
<p>Les Chapieux to Hobo Camping: 25km with 1071m elevation gain.</p>
<h3 id="4">4</h3>
<p>To rejoin the official tour we caught a free bus to Courmayeur where we stocked up at the Carrefour before walking into town.</p>
<p>We ate our lunch atop the first summit and later stopped for an espresso at <a href="https://www.rifugiobonatti.it/en/">Rifugio Bonnati</a>, who only accepted cash.</p>
<p>Our hike ended at Arnuova Desot where we took the free coach down the road to <a href="https://www.grandesjorasses.com/en/">Camping Grandes Jorasses</a>.</p>
<p>Dinner was obviously pizza again.</p>
<p>Courmayeur to Arnuova Desot: 21km with 1255m elevation gain.</p>
<h3 id="5">5</h3>
<p>Day 5 took us into Switzerland. We had originally planned for a long day but ended up cutting it short. We arrived in La Fouly and had a leisurely afternoon taking it slow and resting up.</p>
<p>I had been warned that Switzerland would be more expensive but it wasn&rsquo;t until we went to the supermarket that I really noticed. Some things were just a little bit more, which is fair when you&rsquo;re looking at Canadian Maple Syrup in a remote, tiny skiing village, but the €5 steaks found in France and Italy were now about €20, so instead we bought pasta.</p>
<p>We stayed at <a href="https://www.camping-glaciers.ch/en/">Camping des Glaciers</a> which was about €20 each.</p>
<p>Arnouva Desot to La Fouly: 17km with 820m elevation gain.</p>
<h3 id="6">6</h3>
<p>We combined two segments into one for day 6, thanks to a tip from someone we met on the campsite, so instead of stopping at Champex-Lac we carried on to Col de la Forclaz.</p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t that many campsites for this part of the tour, which makes planning a little difficult, but we found out that there&rsquo;s one attached to a hotel just over the road from the trail.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find any mention of it but now I&rsquo;m home I&rsquo;ve been able to find <a href="https://www.valleedutrient.ch/en/campsite-l-arpille-fp480">their website</a>. We paid about €20 each.</p>
<p>There was a little bit of snow on the trail but we were able to walk around it without special equipment.</p>
<p>La Fouly to Col de la Forclaz: 34.5km with 1397m elevation gain.</p>
<h3 id="7">7</h3>
<p>This was a tough day, both physically and logistically.</p>
<p>We descended into Trient and walked past a campsite. We probably could have made it here the night before but we were glad we stopped walking and camped where we did.</p>
<p>After a ridge walk in the clouds and a long descent through a forest we got a bus into Argentière. This was €2.20 and you pay by scanning your card on one of the ticket machines on the bus, although they aren&rsquo;t always working.</p>
<p>We stocked up at the supermarket before heading to <a href="https://www.campingchamonix.com/en/location/">Camping Glacier D&rsquo;Argentière</a>. Being back in France meant the campsite was a more reasonable €12 each.</p>
<p>Col de la Forclaz to Montroc: 19km with 1145m elevation gain.</p>
<h3 id="8">8</h3>
<p>We caught the bus from Argentière back to the start of the trail. Unfortunately the ticket machines on the bus displayed &ldquo;system inactif&rdquo; and wouldn&rsquo;t let us pay, but we soon got over it.</p>
<p>Our route involved about 10 sets of ladders at about 2000m up. These were ok, even though I don&rsquo;t like heights. It rained a little, which made the metal cold, but I was wearing finger-tip-less merino gloves and didn&rsquo;t notice it.</p>
<p>There are alternative routes that don&rsquo;t involve ladders but I couldn&rsquo;t tell you where they are. As a Brit I was expecting loads of signage warning you about the ladders and where the alternative routes are but I didn&rsquo;t see any. It could have been on the board at the start of the trail that I ignored, but if you don&rsquo;t want to do the ladders I would advise you to lookup the alternative route beforehand.</p>
<p>The refuge next to Lac Blanc charges €1 for the toilets but we were too dehydrated to need them.</p>
<p>We ended our hike at the cable car station at Flégère around 14:00. We had an espresso and were temporarily tempted to carry on to the end of the trail, but then we remembered the advice to start and end hiking as early as possible to avoid the afternoon storms. Once the caffeine wore off we realised that even if today had been shorter than the others it was just as tough.</p>
<p>We had a snack at <a href="https://www.maisondesdrus.com/en/establishment/refuge-flegere-summer/">Refuge de la Flégère</a> before bivouacking at the artificial lake.</p>
<p>Montroc to Flégère: 10km with 1025m elevation gain.</p>
<h3 id="9">9</h3>
<p>Our last day on the trail involved more ascending and even a few more ladders. Most of the morning was spent walking across stones that would have been wet and slippery during a storm so we were glad we camped where we did and tackled this in the morning.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no access to fresh water and not that many streams to filter from for this part of the tour. We remembered reading about this but forgot until we were at the summit and realised we hadn&rsquo;t seen any water for a few hours. Once we started descending again I filtered a bit of water from a giant puddle we found. I hoped this puddle had formed from the storm the day before so I only had a little bit and tried not to think about it.</p>
<p>There was even a sign at <a href="https://www.refuge-bellachat.com/en/refuge">Refuge de Bellachat</a> stating they could not give out water as they did not have much themselves. This was a first for us, as most of the refuges have fresh water available for all, but when you appreciate this one is bolted onto the side of a mountain, about 2000m up in the air, then you can understand why they do it.</p>
<p>We stopped for a citronnade and then the clouds opened up, revealing my favourite view of the whole entire trip.</p>
<p>A long descent down into Chamonix and a bit of road walking took us back to the starting point in Les Houches.</p>
<p>Flégerè to Les Houches: 21km with 875m elevation gain</p>
<h3 id="1-1">+1</h3>
<p>After finishing the tour at Les Houches we got the bus to Chamonix where my hiking buddy carried on travelling home.</p>
<p>My flight was the next day so I walked less than 10 minutes from the Chamonix Sud bus station to <a href="https://www.lesarolles.com/en-gb">Les Arolles</a> and camped there for the night. This was €14.20 for me and my tent and was the only campsite I went to that was <strong>cash only</strong>.</p>
<p>The day after I had breakfast in Chamonix before getting a pre-booked SwissTours coach to Geneva airport in time for my 17:00 flight back home.</p>
<p>Chamonix to North Wales: more than 1000km.</p>
<h2 id="total-distance">Total distance</h2>
<p>In total we walked over 180km and climbed 9.5km of elevation gain in 9 days.</p>

<p>Day 6 was a long one, but Switzerland did not disappoint. I was so tired by the end of the day I almost passed out in my cheese.</p>

			 <p>Kinlochleven to Fort William.</p>
<p>I woke up in a great mood on day 7.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was bitter-sweet though. I was pleased with my progress so far and excited to see the finishing line by the end of the day.</p>
<p>I was having fun, in the great outdoors, away from computer screens and everyday life.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The people I had met were all fantastic.</p>
<p>The weather was only getting better, from the initial Scottish showers leading up to a warm and sunny final day.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want it to end.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But I needed to complete the route.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Just outside of Kinlochleven we stumbled upon neighbour-on-my-first-night, fire-by-Loch-Lomond, had-spoken-to-him-most-days guy. And so our two-some became a three-some.</p>
<p>We had all come away to be by ourselves, to achieve a great personal goal, and yet here we were all walking and talking together.</p>
<p>Reminding each other to look back every once in a while and enjoy the view.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can do the West Highland Way for whatever reason you want but the biggest takeaway for me was that there are plenty of nice interesting people out there, you just need to find them.</p>
<p>These idiots were into walking long distances with all their possessions on their back.</p>
<p>They were my kind of idiot.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I had brought 2 dehydrated meals with me, one for dinner and one for breakfast, to keep my mind at ease throughout the trip. I felt safe knowing I had enough food to last a while in case of an emergency. Maybe I would need to find and filter some water so I could cook them, but that I could deal with at the time.</p>
<p>What I hadn&rsquo;t checked was how much gas I had left in my canister. Which turned out to be not enough.</p>
<p>Luckily I now had 2 people who offered to boil some water for me and it only cost me a few crisps.</p>
<p>Our short lunch break turned into a longer one.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;d spent the rest of the week not understanding why people kept their rain covers on their bags all the time, until orange rain cover guy told me he was using his as extra storage for part of his tent. After which myself and the other third of our three-some also put our rain covers on.</p>
<p>We became the rain cover gang.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was the green one.</p>
<p>Which might sound silly and childish but that&rsquo;s the only way I could summarise our walk together.</p>
<p>After a week on the trail this city kid had most of his worries and anxieties taken away from him. The only thing that mattered was the walk. You only needed enough food for the next few hours, and there was always a friendly face along the way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For one of our breaks I lay down and closed my eyes for a few moments.</p>
<p>Out in the sun, talking with new friends.</p>
<p>I felt like a kid again.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Until we started descending for one last time.</p>
<p>We could see the start of our destination approaching and realised we needed a plan. We would be getting into Fort William way after the last train had left, and the last time we checked the hotels weren&rsquo;t just very expensive they were all fully booked.</p>
<p>So we decided to head to <a href="https://www.glen-nevis.co.uk/campsite/">Glen Nevis campsite</a> where we would set up our tents.</p>
<p>And then complete the route. It was just 5km from there.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First though we had to eat, and since neither of my new walking buddies had tried curry sauce with their chips we stopped at the campfire kitchen.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no photos of that last 5km.</p>
<p>It was tough. It was sad. It was nothing but walking.</p>
<p>We would finish in the time-frame we each had set out to do it in.</p>
<p>And most importantly, we would have completed it.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t really matter if it was that night or in the morning. I knew that, they knew that, and still we all pushed on.</p>
<p>We made it to the <em>original</em> finishing point where we made a momentary pause before continuing. There may have been a grumble or two at this, and they were justified, but there was a bench with an old man sitting on it at the other end of the high street we had to reach.</p>
<p>And then at 21:50, on the 7th day after starting it, I completed The West Highland Way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Looking back I wish I&rsquo;d taken off my shoe so the photo had full effect, but then I&rsquo;d have needed to sit differently because it was actually my other foot that hurt the most.</p>
<p>And I should have brought my bag with me, to complete the picture.</p>
<p>But none of this goes through your head when you&rsquo;ve walked that far for the first time.</p>
<p>All you can think about is sitting on that bench forever.</p>
<p>Content in the knowledge that you&rsquo;ve done it.</p>
<p>And that it went better than you thought it could have.</p>

			 <p>Wild camp to Kinlochleven.</p>
<p>Having wild camped the night before I hadn&rsquo;t recharged my phone or filled up the battery bank I had brought with me.</p>
<p>But I wasn&rsquo;t too bothered.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t need my phone for directions, nor did I need it to talk to anyone, since I&rsquo;d now got a hiking buddy to talk to.</p>
<p>The only thing I might have wanted it for is photos.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you now, day 6 involves taking a photo or two.</p>
<p>First we covered the part of yesterday&rsquo;s route that we hadn&rsquo;t yet finished and then we stopped for breakfast at <a href="https://www.glencoemountain.co.uk/">Glencoe Mountain Resort</a>. I&rsquo;ll be honest and say this wasn&rsquo;t the best breakfast of the week, but it was necessary, so we viewed it more as fuel than food.</p>
<p>Here we bumped into Bubba Ribeye 👋 who was full of stories and advice. We ignored his tip to get a shower there and then because we&rsquo;d already been walking and were aiming for a camp site with showers, so we would wait.</p>
<p>After the mountain resort came <a href="https://www.kingshousehotel.co.uk/">Kingshouse</a> where we bumped into Tim again, someone I had first met on my second day. He told us the reason the hotel had put up a &ldquo;no camping&rdquo; sign on the left side of the bridge was because a few years ago a Scottish stag-do had camped there and the hotel guests woke up to an unpleasant sight of them all naked, urinating into the river.</p>
<p>Moving on from that discussion we continued along the path until it was time for a photo.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t decide that, the scenery did.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;d like to thank my photographer for taking this of me. It&rsquo;s probably the greatest hiking photo of me I could have asked for. It&rsquo;s probably the greatest photo of me full stop.</p>
<p>It was a bit difficult working out where the poles should be to make this extremely posed photo look organic, but I nailed it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We rested at the foot of the Devil&rsquo;s staircase before climbing the two hundred something metres to the top, where the views opened up and we could see Ben Nevis, the tallest mountain in Scotland and the UK, off in the distance.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since breakfast I had only eaten Skittles and Scottish Tablet and eventually started to crash on the descent.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We could see our destination getting closer, so on we marched to Kinlochleven,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>where we set up our tents at the camp site attached to the hostel.</p>
<p>We headed round to the local Co-op to stock up on supplies at a regular shop, instead of <del>an overpriced</del> a higher-priced hiking one.</p>

			 <p>Tyndrum to Kingshouse.</p>
<p>Well, most of the way there.</p>
<p>I woke up on day 5 to my eyes and nose both leaking down my face.
I honestly thought I&rsquo;d caught a cold and was waiting for the lack of energy to kick in.</p>
<p>As soon as it did I knew I&rsquo;d have to either stay and rest a few days or give up and go home.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Until then all I could do was walk.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d hoped for a long day on day 5. The itinerary I was following was for 7 days, and the Walk Highlands app was showing me one for 8 days, which meant I had to combine 2 days into 1.</p>
<p>I stocked up at the Green Welly Stop with vitamin tablets, sports drinks and a sandwich.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The walking was fairly easy, apart from the water dripping down my face.</p>
<p>I had a run-in with some sheep,</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>and then overtook a witch who told me I&rsquo;d feel better by lunch time, and she was right!</p>
<p>By then I&rsquo;d taken a hay-fever tablet I&rsquo;d brought with me as a just-in-case, and it solidified the leaks and it all became easier to deal with. It was still annoying, but at least I knew what it was and that I could continue.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My mood improved instantly when I got to Bridge of Orchy,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>because I saw my first ever wild deer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I wish the photos didn&rsquo;t have so many man-made structures in them, and that they looked more wild,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>but they&rsquo;re still the best photos of wild deer I&rsquo;ve ever taken.</p>
<p>Better than the hikers in front of me as well since they didn&rsquo;t see any deer.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I had a pleasant stop at Inveroran. I&rsquo;d already got everything I needed, so this was just topping up my sugar levels and resting my legs for a few minutes.</p>
<p>I got to talking to someone else wearing a sun hoodie, clearly a man of excellent taste, and we shared updates on our blisters.</p>
<p>I let him carry on ahead of me. Maybe I would catch him up?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I did catch him up. His blisters were getting the better of him. We continued the conversation.</p>
<p>I had not come to talk to anyone, and certainly not to make any friends, and yet this was a nice change for me.</p>
<p>I had made small-talk with a few people before on the trail, it was hard not to when you would see them again and again each day, but this at this point we were sore and talking took our minds off the aches and pains.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We had both set out to have a big day that day. It turned out my new hiking buddy even wanted to finish the route on the same day as me, so it made sense to stick together.</p>
<p>We passed the Dutch couple we had previously spoken to, they had made camp beside the trail because they had had enough walking that day.</p>
<p>It seemed like a good idea, but we carried on.</p>
<p>Then we passed the Czech lads that we had previously spoken to, who had made camp beside the trail.</p>
<p>We were starting to agree with them.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I hadn&rsquo;t come to Scotland to camp out in the wild, I can do that at home, but my new hiking friend had come from Germany, where it&rsquo;s even more illegal than in the UK, so he was keen.</p>
<p>We found a raised section just off the path with a few places to pitch a tent. It was a bit windy so there would be no bugs to annoy us.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As you can see in the photo, our spot was <em>just</em> off the path. In Wales, where I normally go camping, this would be a big no. If you do wildcamp, which you&rsquo;re not supposed to, you must be stealthy and not let anyone know you were there. Pitch up as it gets dark and leave before it&rsquo;s light sort of thing.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s different in Scotland. They have a <a href="https://www.righttoroam.org.uk/">Right to Roam</a> that the rest of us don&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>A group of Scottish hikers even greeted us with a song in the morning.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was initially hesitant about setting up camp on the side of the path with a stranger I had met only a few hours before, but I&rsquo;m glad I did.</p>
<p>This was my favourite camp site of the whole week.</p>

			 <p>Inverarnan to Tyndrum.</p>
<p>I was still recovering on the morning of day 4, so I had a full Scottish breakfast at the Stagger Inn on the camp site before I left.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I did&rsquo;t take a photo of my food but it was great. Instead you can also admire the weird shit they had on the walls.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As well as the guest book I didn&rsquo;t sign.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I had trimmed my toe nails before setting off but my little toe had somehow grown a pointy bit that was stabbing into my other toe. Luckily the on-site shop had supplies to sort me out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The shop was also where I had a nice conversation with another camper. No names, just talking. I was starting to like this talking to other people idea.</p>
<p>Packing up my things to leave a neighbour noticed I had used my towel to wipe the water off my tent and recommended using a sponge instead.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t preachy, it was just advice from one camper to another. And he was right, my towel was damp for the rest of the week after that.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The difficult walking was all done with.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today would be much easier.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In fact the only difficult parts were crouching underneath the sheep dips,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>avoiding puddles,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and trying to slow myself down from the dancing pace I had settled into.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Eventually I passed through a sheep farm,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>where I was lucky enough to witness a shepherd and his dog in action.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Getting closer to Tyndrum was a very tiny shop selling supplies.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All the profits went to the local school, who were raising money to buy a new climbing frame.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any actual money on me and I felt terrible. I had wanted to support the local economy during my trip, and here I was with a perfect outlet for it, and yet I only had my card on me.</p>
<p>I ended up spending hundreds of pounds playing on their local climbing frame, and yet I couldn&rsquo;t find a way to spare a couple quid for the children to have their own.</p>
<p>Luckily the pizza rocks were free.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the ideal gift to give a hiker who still has 75km to walk, but it weighed less than the guilt.</p>
<p>Getting closer to Tyndrum I stumbled upon a Lochan that may or may not contain Robert the Bruce&rsquo;s sword,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>but I didn&rsquo;t check.</p>
<p>I arrived in Tyndrum at a much more reasonable time than the day before, feeling a hell of a lot better for the easier path and slower pace of the day.</p>
<p>The route takes you past <a href="https://highlandholidays.com/parks/tyndrum/">a holiday park</a> with big signs that they have hot tubs. I will admit I was slightly tempted, but something told me to continue roughing it in my tent. It&rsquo;d feel better in the long run.</p>
<p>So I setup camp in a corner of <a href="https://tyndrumbytheway.com/">By the Way</a> campsite, looking at this saggy tent,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>before heading up the road to the <a href="https://thetyndruminn.co.uk/">Tyndrum Inn</a> where I sat outside,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and had the best Haggis, Neeps and Tatties I&rsquo;ve ever had,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>before settling in for the evening and watching <a href="https://youtu.be/llonMgKYes0?si=UDOQ6X-gIjT4oBAm">Good Bloke Outdoors' video</a> on the insanely low amount of things he took on the same route as me,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>Shoutout to Bocsa Bean for having ready to eat bananas.</p>
<p>The coffee helped wake me up, the banana replenished some potassium, but it was probably the walking that actually fixed me.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Or maybe it was the sweets from the honesty box.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Paused for a moment at the WW2 memorial, thinking of all the Scottish lives lost.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And then it was on with the walk.</p>
<p>As mentioned in day 2 the loch-side walk was difficult. Not impossible, or anything I hadn&rsquo;t done before, it&rsquo;s just that it kept going with no real stops to break up the journey.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I stopped at some of the waterfalls for a hydration break along the way.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It had rained just ever so slightly all morning,</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>but I was wearing a merino wool sun hoodie so I got away with it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At some point the sun decided to join us, so I sat by the loch and let my feet air out for a bit.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The smell can&rsquo;t have been that bad,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>as a couple came over to do the same thing.</p>
<p>We had a nice view.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There were a few points where the path got quite close to the loch,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>but mostly the walking was ok.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Eventually I reached the end of the loch, where a familiar face was making camp on the shore:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don&rsquo;t normally do fires when I&rsquo;m camping, but the bugs were relentless so I understood. Plus this spot had fantastic views of the loch and surrounding hills. I would go on thinking about this camp site for days.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The trail started to become easier but by this point I was tired. The excitement of realising I only had 5km left meant I had started&hellip; skipping&hellip; along the trail. Which was fun, but it tired me out and I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to smile when I got to camp.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Dinner fixed that.</p>

			 <p>Drymen to permitted wild camp next to Loch Lomond.</p>
<p>Day 2 was the first of two days walking beside Loch Lomond.</p>
<p>It would also be the first day I&rsquo;d wake up in a tent and then go to sleep in it since I was a child going car camping.</p>
<p>The route starts at Drymen and ends at Rowardennan but I was aiming for a permit only wild camp spot by the side of the loch just before Rowardennan.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After the trail through Garadhban forest the route went over Conic Hill, which had been closed off earlier in the year to repair the path.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It’s re-opened now but the path is still being worked on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I met a lot of cyclists pushing their bikes up the other side who probably weren’t too pleased about that.</p>
<p>There was a constant stream of people heading to the summit, and then onto a lower plateau to get a better view of the loch.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Because the views were worth it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Coming down the other side of the hill the path went through a peaceful forest,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>where I stopped to listen to the birds,</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>before continuing on to Balmaha where I grabbed some sandwiches.</p>
<p>Met Tim 👋, who is also walking the West Highland Way, and then <em>another</em> week long trip, and then maybe the length of Britain, which is three and a half months of walking. Hope you enjoy it Tim that sounds like a hell of a challenge.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Learnt a bit about Tom Weir. He championed the outdoors in Scotland and I guess, even if indirectly, helped with the formation of routes like the West Highland Way. Thanks Tom.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Topped up my water at a free tap.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These should be everywhere.</p>
<p>Then onto the loch-side trail, which was tough, full of tree roots and would go up one minute just to go back down again a minute later.</p>
<p>This will feature again in day 3, so I’ll leave it out for now.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Saw a pretty cottage.</p>
<p>Then more undulating path.</p>
<p>Then eventually I saw the sign for the permitted camp spot,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>and I’m not joking when I say I ran for it.</p>
<p>Well, I tried to. I managed about three strides before my legs reverted back to walking again. I was exhausted. It was a good sign to see.</p>
<p>Not long after the tent was pitched. I enjoyed my themed beer from Balmaha, held off the midges for a while and then went to bed.</p>

			 <p>The West Highland Way has loads of information available online.</p>
<p>It has <a href="https://www.westhighlandway.org/">its own website</a> with everything you would need to know about it, such as <a href="https://www.westhighlandway.org/the-route/">the route</a>, <a href="https://www.westhighlandway.org/the-route/suggested-itineraries/">suggested itineraries</a> and even links to <a href="https://www.westhighlandway.org/location/">accommodation available on the route</a>.</p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t need any other resources.</p>
<h2 id="youtube">Youtube</h2>
<p>This year it seems like most of the UK wildcamping Youtubers have walked The Way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYfd4lZe1K4">Andy Beavers</a> was the first one I saw. He did it in 3 days, which was inspiring but not something I could replicate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRlrvVMMNtU">Backpacking UK</a> did it in a more reasonable time of 5 days, but that still looked like too much of a challenge for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z015CycR2pA&amp;list=PLbU28ZzUOa49qFqV3d99ATSR6T6bAL92U">Paul Messner&rsquo;s series</a> is for an itinerary of 7 days, which looked ideal to me.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s videos helped me get into wild camping in the first place, so it was no surprise that it was his series that pushed me over the edge to start booking things. I copied most of Paul&rsquo;s itinerary and tried to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the bits he said he wished had gone differently.</p>
<p>On the train up I also enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCC66yRmW0I&amp;list=PL4lBodIR0QiRL2T1xApJrE7BcuV0xPIds&amp;pp=iAQB">Stephen J. Reid&rsquo;s series</a> even if he&rsquo;d only uploaded the first half of the trip by then.</p>
<p>And on one of my earlier nights, where I lay in my tent watching videos I&rsquo;d downloaded when I had WiFi, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llonMgKYes0&amp;list=PLOgJ9RoGt7803K7NdUrxZdmmGhxAukyrv&amp;pp=iAQB">Good Bloke Outdoors</a>. He did it in 3.5 days with a 35L bag, which again was impressive but not something I could replicate, at least on this trip.</p>
<p>Thanks to all of the above for sharing their journey with us, but especially Paul for setting a challenge I could attempt myself.</p>
<h2 id="the-walk-highlands-app">The Walk Highlands App</h2>
<p>On the trail itself the most helpful resource of all was the Walk Highlands app.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d taken notes on my phone, and tried to memorise the important parts of the journey, but there was nothing as good as using your phone, completely offline, to know exactly where you were, how long was left and what kind of terrain you were about to encounter, especially when you were tired.</p>
<p>The app itself is just a website, <a href="https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk">www.walkhighlands.co.uk</a>, but on a phone you can press the share button in your browser to add it to your home screen where it acts like an app installed from the app store.</p>
<p>This means it can download files into local storage on your phone, so when you have internet access you can get the next day&rsquo;s itinerary and then use GPS to tell you where you are on that map, even without internet access.</p>
<p>You have to click a button first to say you have a real map with you, which initially you&rsquo;ll do without thinking, but eventually you&rsquo;ll realise how fragile your phone is and that maybe you should have brought a map just in case.</p>
<p>The app covers the rest of the Highlands, which probably isn&rsquo;t as well sign-posted as the West Highland Way, nor would it have as good 5G coverage, so on a real Highlands route I&rsquo;d insist on taking a physical map.</p>
<p>But on the West Highland Way? I&rsquo;ll just say the signage was excellent and I survived without.</p>
<h2 id="my-itinerary">My Itinerary</h2>
<h3 id="0">0</h3>
<p>I could have gotten a stupidly early train up to Glasgow and then on to Milngavie but that didn&rsquo;t sound like fun to me.</p>
<p>So I caught the train up to Glasgow the night before and stayed in the cheapest Premier Inn I could find. It was a 45 minute walk from the train station to save £30 on the hotel but I&rsquo;d have sat on trains for almost 5 hours by then and a walk sounded nice.</p>
<p>Plus I used some of that £30 to have a big breakfast before setting off.</p>
<h3 id="1">1</h3>
<p>I got the train from Glasgow to the start of the walk in Milngavie.</p>
<p><a href="https://drymencamping.co.uk/">Drymen Camping</a> was my first destination. I had booked on to a camp site so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about the end of my first day.</p>
<p>The camp site&rsquo;s on the side of the road that the route takes so it&rsquo;s difficult to miss. It&rsquo;s just after an honesty box and warnings about free-roaming chickens.</p>
<p>Milngavie to Drymen: 19km</p>
<h3 id="2">2</h3>
<p>My second destination was a <a href="https://www.lochlomond-trossachs.org/things-to-do/camping/get-a-permit/">permitted wild camp zone</a> called Lochan Maol Dhuinne. This was something Paul Messner mentioned in his video and it looked like a good idea.</p>
<p>It was amongst the trees so I took a ground sheet for my tent and I&rsquo;m glad I did, the ground was littered with dangerous pine cones and deadly pine needles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d stocked up in Balmaha for that evening&rsquo;s supplies.</p>
<p>Drymen to Lochan Maol Dhuinne: 23km</p>
<h3 id="3">3</h3>
<p>The last of my pre-booking was for <a href="https://beinglascampsite.co.uk/">Beinglas campsite</a>. The walk next to Loch Lomond is the hardest walking section of the whole route so I was glad to have that evening&rsquo;s stay already sorted out.</p>
<p>The route goes straight through the camp site so you can&rsquo;t miss it.</p>
<p>I arrived just before the kitchen closed at 20:45 and in the morning had breakfast before stocking up on supplies in the shop.</p>
<p>Lochan Maol Dhuinne to Rowardennan: 1km
Rowardennan to Inverarnan: 22.5km</p>
<h3 id="4">4</h3>
<p>You can&rsquo;t pre-book online for camping at <a href="https://tyndrumbytheway.com/">By the Way</a> but it was my intended destination for night 4. I knew I wanted to spend the night in or around Tyndrum because I wanted Haggis, Neeps and Tatties from the <a href="https://thetyndruminn.co.uk/">Tyndrum Inn</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d had this at a wedding in Ayr the year before and knew I had to have it again, made properly, so when I saw it in Paul&rsquo;s video I decided there and then that day 4 had to include it.</p>
<p>The following morning I stocked up at <a href="https://www.thegreenwellystop.co.uk/">The Green Welly Stop</a> before leaving Tyndrum.</p>
<p>Inverarnan to Tyndrum: 19km</p>
<h3 id="5">5</h3>
<p>The Walk Highlands app shows an itinerary for 8 days but I was trying to follow one for 7 days. This meant I would need to do a double day either day 5 or 6.</p>
<p>Except I woke up with my eyes and nose watering from hay-fever I didn&rsquo;t know I had. This meant I had a late start and I didn&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d need to abandon the trip.</p>
<p>Luckily a witch told me everything would be fine, and she was right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d already stocked up in the morning but I stopped at Inveroran for a drink and a snack from the shop and had a rest in the seating area outside. Here I bumped into someone who had camped right in front of me the night before and we started talking whilst walking.</p>
<p>After 23km that day they suggested we wild camp beside the trail, just like the Dutch couple and the Czech lads we had just walked past. I&rsquo;m glad we did.</p>
<p>Tyndrum to wild camp: 23km</p>
<h3 id="6">6</h3>
<p>Day 6 needed to make up for the 7km I missed out on the day before.</p>
<p>We made it to <a href="https://www.glencoemountain.co.uk/">Glencoe Mountain Resort</a> just before breakfast ended and from there it wasn&rsquo;t far to <a href="https://www.kingshousehotel.co.uk/">Kingshouse</a>.</p>
<p>After some photos it was 15km to Kinlochleven where my new hiking buddy and I camped at <a href="https://blackwaterhostel.co.uk/campsite/">Blackwater Hostel</a> and stocked up at the local Co-op.</p>
<p>Wild camp to Kinlochleven: 22km</p>
<h3 id="7">7</h3>
<p>Day 7 was when it seemed possible I could finish in 7 days. This was a subject that infuriated a few people I&rsquo;d been overtaking, but I had originally set out to complete the walk in 7 days and now I was so close I was determined to make it happen. Plus my new hiking buddy had a similar goal for completing it in 6 days and this was their 6th day.</p>
<p>That doesn&rsquo;t mean we didn&rsquo;t take lots of breaks, or lots of photos, or have a long lunch with a third hiking buddy we had acquired in the morning, it just meant we were determined to finish that day.</p>
<p>However none of us had really considered the logistics of crossing the finishing line. We would all be finishing the walk late at night, after the trains to Glasgow had ended, surrounded by £200 per night hotels that all seemed to be fully booked.</p>
<p>So instead we set up our tents at <a href="https://www.glen-nevis.co.uk/campsite/">Glen Nevis campsite</a>, had a quick snack, and then walked the last 5km to the finishing point. And then that extra little bit from the original finishing point to the new one in the middle of the high street.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in the rules saying you have to be wearing your backpack for your photo on the bench at the finishing point, nor anything about getting a taxi back to your tent after.</p>
<p>Not that we would have cared much by then. We were tired, we were aching, and we had done it.</p>
<p>Kinlochleven to Fort William: 24km</p>
<h3 id="8">8</h3>
<p>The following morning it rained, and there were plenty of other hikers doing that last 5km, so I&rsquo;m glad we finished the night before.</p>
<p>It meant the day was all about breakfast, packing up and leaving, instead of trying to cram it all in and presumably waiting in a queue to get a soggy photo. We got a taxi to the train station for £10.</p>
<p>The train from Fort William to Glasgow leaves every few hours, but to get home in one day I had to get the earliest one. The views were amazing. We covered most of the ground I&rsquo;d just spent a week walking in only a few hours. I saw countless majestic mountains and even a herd of wild deer prancing around a field.</p>
<p>Fort William to home: 600km</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Hiking the West Highland Way was a very personal challenge for me.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://pinthewild.micro.blog/2024/06/28/why-i-got.html">my first wildcamp</a> I had been a weekend warrior,  walking 10km, camping for the night, and then going home again the next day.</p>
<p>Sometimes I went with a friend, one time with two, but mostly my trips were about finding peace and solitude amongst the hills.</p>
<p>I liked it but I knew there was more to it.</p>
<h2 id="time-for-a-challenge">Time for a challenge</h2>
<p>After five years at the same job I was entitled to a sabbatical. It was unpaid, so it would cost me in missed wages, but I&rsquo;d built up some savings to use and the opportunity to take a break was too good to miss out on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d read about <a href="https://www.cambrianway.org.uk/">the Cambrian Way</a> and thought it seemed suitable. The route starts in the south of Wales and ends in the north, not far from where I&rsquo;m currently living.</p>
<p>The only problem?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 479km (298 miles) long and takes about 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Which is 2 weeks and 6 days longer than I&rsquo;d ever been out before.</p>
<p>Then I noticed that all the UK Youtubers that I watch were all walking the West Highland Way, calling it an &ldquo;easy first multi-day trip&rdquo; and saying that the support system around it was very good. The route was well sign-posted and there would be plenty of places to stock up on supplies along the way.</p>
<p>It was 154km (96 miles) and the suggested itineraries ranged from 5 to 8 days.</p>
<p>Which sounded much more reasonable to me.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>My primary goal was to complete the route.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d never walked that far before so I had no idea how long it would take me, nor did I really care.
When I set out I wasn&rsquo;t sure I would even make it to day three, and if I did then I had been out longer than I ever had before.</p>
<p>Completing the route meant I was a real hiker, one who could handle a multi-day trip.</p>
<p>Wild camping is legal in Scotland, but that wasn&rsquo;t really an aim of mine, since I can do that at home. I was ok staying at camp sites, making the most of the facilities, plus I felt like I was actively contributing to the local economy this way. I would pay my dues for the local population to put up with the countless hikers, including myself, invading their roads and trails.</p>
<p>I also didn&rsquo;t really care about talking to anyone. I didn&rsquo;t go to make any friends, I just wanted to prove to myself I was a real hiker and that I could do this.</p>

			 <p>On the surface wildcamping ticks a lot of boxes for me.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hiking and camping, both things I like separately, but it turns out it&rsquo;s way more than that.</p>
<p>Getting out on my own, summiting a mountain and then hanging around long enough to see sunset and sunrise has been great for my mental health.</p>
<p>Otherwise I&rsquo;d be sat at my desk typing away at something ridiculous.</p>
<h2 id="how">How</h2>
<p>The actual event that got me into wildcamping was a weekend in a friend&rsquo;s brand new caravan. This thing was nicer than the last apartment I had lived in. It reminded me of camping as a child, but that always felt like &ldquo;roughing it&rdquo;, so it was nothing like that.</p>
<p>Everything was clean. We had the music on because there was power available. It felt wrong.</p>
<p>To get there I&rsquo;d needed to travel coast to coast across the UK, from west to east, which meant buying a better bag to hold all my things. This involved looking at lots of bags online and some of those were meant for serious expeditions. Which made me realise it was possible to go camping by yourself.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d gone camping as a child, in the car, with loads of heavy things, so I thought you needed a car to go camping. Later I would go camping with friends at university, where we each carried part of a four man tent, so I thought you needed a group to go camping.</p>
<p>And yet here were bags that could carry all the things you needed to go camping by yourself.</p>
<h2 id="what">What</h2>
<p>My mind was blown. I needed to have a go.</p>
<p>So I started where most of us do when getting into a new hobby and went on YouTube. There&rsquo;s always one person into that weird thing you just found out exists. Maybe I could find out more about this on there.</p>
<p>And I did. There were loads of videos, from all around the world. Even better than that, there were people from the UK who were sharing their opinions on gear and whether or not they were suitable for the weather we get over here.</p>
<h2 id="when">When</h2>
<p>A few months later and I had amassed enough gear to do it. I would head out into the wilderness and survive for the entire night. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t die and I really hoped I wouldn&rsquo;t need to call Mountain Rescue.</p>
<p>So on the 29th of October, 2022, I headed out to an area I had walked in just a week before. I would be somewhere somewhat familiar but wild enough for it to still be exciting.</p>
<p>I had read that it was easier to fall asleep in your tent if you were tired, so my plan was to tire myself out during the day so that falling asleep in the wild would be easier.</p>
<p>After walking all day, up and over two separate hills, one with a burger named after it in the local pub, I found a suitable pitch.</p>
<p>Half an hour of messing around with my tent in the wind and it was up and I could get in and lie down.</p>
<p>And lying down there in that tent was when it hit me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Why did I do this?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It had been raining all day. My fingers were wrinkly from the moisture. My waterproof trousers had slipped down at some point and my trousers had gotten wet from the rain. My underwear was soaked.</p>
<p>My bum was cold.
Very cold.</p>
<p>And all I had was a tent and all the things I&rsquo;d carried with me. None of which were a towel.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t very happy.</p>
<p>But in the morning?</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>I had survived.</p>
<p>I had done it!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d spent years of my life inside, sat at a desk working on a computer, sometimes two. I genuinely didn&rsquo;t know if I had it in me to make it through the night.</p>
<p>Which would probably be a very important step in surviving the zombie apocalypse, because that&rsquo;s what I was actually interested in. Improving my fitness, learning new skills, getting outside. None of it mattered unless there was a good reason I was doing any of it.</p>
<p>And that reason was to improve my chances of surviving the undead.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s yours?</p>
